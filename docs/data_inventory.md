## Odds Verification and Join Rates (DATA-2)

We verified the availability of opening and closing odds across Pinnacle, Bet365, Market Average, and Market Maximum.
Pinnacle serves as the primary sharp reference for de-vigging and has a strict 95%+ coverage requirement.

| League | Total Matches | Pinnacle Opening | Pinnacle Closing | Bet365 Opening | Bet365 Closing | Market Avg Opening | Market Avg Closing | Market Max Opening | Market Max Closing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Championship | 2760 | 89.42% | 89.82% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% |
| League One | 2760 | 85.98% | 85.98% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% |

### ⚠️ Pinnacle 25/26 Data Limitation
During verification, we identified a critical data collection limitation in the raw source files from Football-Data.co.uk:
- **Seasons 21/22 to 24/25**: Pinnacle opening and closing odds have **100.00%** coverage.
- **Season 25/26**: Pinnacle coverage drops to **49.09%** (Championship) and **29.89%** (League One) due to scraping failures/omissions at the source from late October 2025 onwards.
- **Mitigation**: Bet365, Market Average, and Market Maximum are **100.00%** populated across all seasons (including 25/26). Downstream de-vigging in Epic 4 will fall back to Market Average odds (`AvgH/D/A`, `AvgCH/CD/CA`) for matches where Pinnacle odds are missing, ensuring no training data is lost.

## Team Name Normalisation (DATA-3)

To ensure that rolling-form, fatigue, and head-to-head calculations do not break or fragment across varying team abbreviations (especially for newly promoted/relegated clubs), we normalise all team names to standard full canonical forms.

### Mapping Configuration
- **Location**: [`/docs/team_name_mapping.json`](file:///c:/Users/jacob/Documents/Sport-Betting-Engine/docs/team_name_mapping.json)
- **Scope**: Covers all 67 unique raw team names across the Championship and League One for seasons 21/22 through 25/26 (totaling 117 entries).
- **Rule**: Every canonical team name maps to itself (e.g. `"Coventry City": "Coventry City"`, `"Luton Town": "Luton Town"`). Shortened raw names (e.g., `"West Brom"`, `"Nott'm Forest"`, `"QPR"`) are normalised to their full canonical forms.

### Downstream Dependency (Epic 2)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Epic 2 Hard Dependency**: Normalisation must be fully complete before Epic 2 (Feature Engineering) begins. This prevents team history fragmentation and ensures that rolling-form calculations track teams correctly across seasons and promotions/relegations.
